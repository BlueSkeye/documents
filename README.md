## ROBust and privacy-presERving proximity Tracing protocol          

The main goal of proximity tracing mobile applications is to notify people that they have been in close proximity of COVID-19 virus carriers in the last N days even though the carriers who did not have symptoms and were not even tested at the time of interaction. Ensuring the highest data protection and security standards will encourage a quick and broad adoption by citizens. 

This document proposes a ROBust and privacy-presERving proximity Tracing (ROBERT) scheme that relies on a federated server infrastructure and temporary anonymous identifiers with strong security and privacy guarantees. 

## Who we are

The ROBERT scheme is the result of a collaborative work between Inria (collaborative effort led by PRIVATICS team) and Fraunhofer AISEC. We are a group of privacy and security researchers -- we have first rigorously analysed security and privacy implications of our scheme, and now provide the first version of our protocol to the community. We decided to follow the research convention of opening up documents only when we are sure about their quality. 


### In this repository you will find: 

* the detailed technical specification of the protocol

* a high-level discussion on the misleading debate about centralised versus decentralised approaches

* a simplified high-level overview of the protocol along with an FAQ (in English and French)

* a comic that explains ROBERT protocol and answers basic questions  (in English and French)

### How to comment?

We will be happy to receive your constructive  comments and questions using the standard "issues" tab above. The "pull requests" tab is not expected to be usefull in this context.

Please refrain from discussing technical aspects of ROBERT protocol on Twitter. We encourage you instead to create a new "issue" or continue discussing in an existing non-closed "issues" thread.
